# Tollgate Automation Using Image Processing

The project is aimed at providing an effective solution for the problem of manual toll collection system applied at the toll gates. As of now, at each poll the vehicle has to stop for paying the toll leading to the wastage of time, energy and resources. In order to reduce the problems of vehicle congestion and time consumption the toll collection is made automatic using the number plate detection technique for identification of vehicles. Automatic number plate recognition is a mass surveillance method that uses optical character recognition on images to read the number plates on the vehicles. Existing old circuit televisions or road-rule enforcement cameras, or specifically designed systems can be used for the purpose. Any registered user can pay the toll before the start of the journey and the necessary details of payment will be saved in the database. When the car reaches the toll plaza, the number plate will be captured using high resolution cameras and the license number of the car will be generated. This number can be used to verify whether the toll has been paid for the specific vehicle or not. Once verified the gates would be opened. The intended benefits of this system are to reduce overall toll-collection costs, provide an acceptable level of service for toll patrons, increase data quality, and reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, and fuel consumption on toll roads
